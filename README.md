# Hacking with Linux and Python

### For my nephew

I installed Ubuntu on an Toshiba laptop

### Installations
- Tuxtyping
- Kanagram
- Ktouch
- KBruch
- Kgeography
- Anaconda3

I added a desktop shortcut that started jupyter notebook, and another that will pull this repo using .desktop files.  For simplicity I will put the notebooks in the rootdir of this repo.

Enjoy!
